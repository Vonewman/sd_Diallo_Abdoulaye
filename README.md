# Welcome to my project on data structures.

This project focuses on handling files in CSV, XML, JSON, and YAML formats.

## Installation

Before running the program, ensure that the required Python packages are installed: **_xmltodict_** and **_dicttoxml_**.

To install these dependencies, execute the following command:

```python3
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, you can use the program in two ways:

1- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**:

To interact with the program via the terminal, run:

```python3
$ python3 cli.py
```

This will launch the CLI, allowing you to work with the supported file formats.

2- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:

To use the program with a graphical interface, run:

```python3
$ python3 GUI.py
```

Note: The GUI is built using Tkinter.
